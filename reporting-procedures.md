# Community Member Procedure For Reporting Code of Conduct Incidents

**If you believe someone is in physical danger, including from themselves**, the most important thing is to get that person help. Please contact the appropriate crisis number, non-emergency number, or police number. If you are in a PSF-sponsored conference or meeting, you can consult with a volunteer or staff member to help find an appropriate number.

If you believe someone has violated the [PSF Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/), we encourage you to report it. If you are unsure whether the incident is a violation, or whether the space where it happened is covered by the Code of Conduct, we encourage you to still report it. We are fine with receiving reports where we decide to take no action for the sake of creating a safer space.

Each PSF-controlled meeting or online forum should have a designated moderator or Code of Conduct point of contact.  Larger gatherings, like conferences, may have several people to contact. Specific information should be available for each PSF-affiliated gathering, online or off. 

If you find that you need to make a report, and you cannot find the appropriate Code of Conduct reporting contact, you may report to the PSF Code of Conduct email alias below. The PSF will handle your report. If this happens, please also mention that you could not find specific reporting information so that we can improve.

*General PSF reporting procedure:*

The best way to contact the PSF Code of Conduct working group is by email at **<conduct@python.org>**. The members of the Code of Conduct Working Group who monitor this alias are listed at the [PSF Code of Conduct Workgroup Charter's List of Participants](https://wiki.python.org/psf/ConductWG/Charter#List_of_Participants.2FWho_we_are). 

In the event of a [conflict of interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest), you may directly contact any of the lead incident responders:

  * Deb Nicholson
    * Python Software Foundation - Executive Director
    * <deb@python.org>
  * Łukasz Langa
    * Python Software Foundation - Code of Conduct WG Chair
    * <lukasz@python.org>
  * Tania Allard
    * Python Software Foundation Director
    * <taniar.allard@gmail.com>
  * Drew Winstel
    * Python Code of Conduct WG Member
    * <drew@defna.org>

You can also contact any member of the Python Software Foundation [Board of Directors](https://www.python.org/psf/board/#id1) to make a report. Certain gatherings and online fora will have additional lead responders for the purpose of helping address incidents in particular PSF-affiliated spaces. 

## Report Data

When you make a report via email or phone, please include:

* Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)
* Date and time of the incident
* Location of incident
* Whether the incident is ongoing
* Description of the incident
* Identifying information of the reported person: name, physical appearance, height, clothing, voice accent, identifying badge information such as company name, ribbons, or badge number
* Additional circumstances surrounding the incident
* Other people involved in or witnesses to the incident and their contact information or description

Please provide as much information as possible.

## Confidentiality

**All reports will be kept confidential**. When we discuss incidents with people who are reported, we will anonymize details as much as we can to protect reporter privacy.

However, some incidents happen in one-on-one interactions, and even if the details are anonymized, the reported person may be able to guess who made the report. If you have concerns about retaliation or your personal safety, please note those in your report. We still encourage you to report, so that we can support you while keeping our conference attendees safe. In some cases, we can compile several anonymized reports into a pattern of behavior, and take action on that pattern.

In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need to be made. If that's the case, the identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

## Report Handling Procedure

When you make a report to an incident responder, they will gather information about the incident according to the Python Software Foundation [Procedure For Incident Response]().

After an incident responder takes the report, they will immediately consult with the Code of Conduct Working Group, unless there is a conflict of interest, in which case any non-interested parties will be contacted. 

If the incident is ongoing and needs to be immediately addressed, any lead incident responder may take appropriate action to ensure the safety of everyone involved. If the situation requires it, this may take the form of a referral to an appropriate non-PSF agency, including the local police. The PSF is not equipped to handle emergency situations.

If the incident is less urgent, the report will be discussed by the Code of Conduct Working Group will meet to determine an appropriate response. Examples of possible incident responses are outlined in the PSF [Procedure For Incident Response]().

Before any large in-person gathering conference, staff will have a mandatory meeting where incident response procedures will be outlined. After the conference, all incident responders will attend a debriefing session with the lead responders to discuss all incidents and determine any necessary follow-up actions.

## Following Up With Reporters

Within one week of an incident report, the a member of the Code of Conduct Working Group, or one of the lead responders, will follow up with the person who made the report and provided their contact information. The follow up may include:

* An acknowledgment that the Code of Conduct responders discussed the situation
* Whether or not the report was determined to be a violation of the Code of Conduct
* What actions (if any) were taken to correcting the reporter behavior

In some cases, the lead responders may need to ask additional questions about the incident in order to identify the reported person.

## Conflicts of Interest

If an incident responder has a conflict of interest for a report, they will recuse themselves from the discussion and handling of the incident. The incident documentation will not be available to them, and they will excuse themselves from any conversations involving handling the incident.

Should more than two of the PSF lead incident responders need to recuse themselves, another PSF Board member will step in as a temporary lead incident responder.
